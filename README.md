## üìÉ Description

Holograph provides omnichain NFT infrastructure for the web3 ecosystem. Holograph Protocol enables the creation, deployment, minting, & bridging of omnichain NFTs with complete data integrity.

## üõ´ Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Setup sample env

```bash
yarn run init
```

### Compile contracts

```bash
yarn clean-compile
```

### Run local chains (restart ganache after every full test run)

Terminal 1

```bash
yarn ganache-x2
```

### Run the tests

Terminal 2

```bash
yarn test
```

After this completes, don't forget to restart ganache. Some tests may fail upon running a second time.

### Building

When the project is built, the code in the `src` folder gets written to the `contracts` folder. The files in the `contracts` folder are the "real" files that are used for testing and code verification on all the scanners.

Again, files from the `src` directory are automatically transpiled into the `contracts` directory each time that **hardhat** compiles the contracts.

## ü§î Areas Of Concern

1. Bridging NFTs
   - Can bridge tokens be sent out to a secondary network?
   - Can bridge tokens be received on the secondary network?
   - Can someone bridge an NFT while not being the owner of the NFT?
   - Can a payload be constructed to exploit or spoof a bridge request?
2. Jobs
   - Can a bridge job be created to manually select an operator?
   - Can a bridge job be created to manually select a pod?
   - Can a bridge job be completed by the primary operator?
   - Can a bridge job be completed by a secondary operator, if the primary operator has not completed the job?
   - Can a bridge job be completed by ANYONE after primary and secondary operators fail to complete a job?
   - Are job operators who fail to complete jobs slashed correctly?
3. Operator
   - Can an operator bond to a pod?
   - Can an operator bond to a pod that does not exist?
   - Can an operator join a pod without bonding?
   - Are the bond amounts computed correct?
   - Can the bond amount be exploited? spoofed?
   - Are operators
   - Can an operator remove their bond?
   - Can an operator remove their bond after being slashed?
